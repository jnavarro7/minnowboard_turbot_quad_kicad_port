# minnowboard_turbot_quad_kicad_port
Port of the MinnowBoard Turbot quad core design files to KiCad 
If I am not mistaken the shared project was created using Cadence tools.  
Basically I aim to port the schematic as a first, this will include work to create new symbols for parts not included in KiCad, like the Atom E3845 Quad Core CPU, etc. 
Maybe this will gain traction and people will start using this to make their own single board computers.
