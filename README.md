# minnowboard_turbot_quad_kicad_port
Port of the MinnowBoard Turbot quad core design files to KiCad. 
 
If I am not mistaken the shared project was created using Cadence tools.  

Basically I aim to port the schematic as a first, this will include work to create new symbols for parts not included in KiCad, like the Atom E3845 Quad Core CPU, etc.
